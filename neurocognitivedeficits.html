        <h2>Working Memory Impairment</h2>

        <p>Working memory is the ability of holding information in temporary storage, manipulating it, and using it to guide subsequent behavior. While working memory requires the holding of information line working memory also involves active manipulation of the information, particularly as the memory load increases. According to the research, the schizophrenia patients exhibited significant impairment in memory-guided response. Follow-up testing of spatial working memory in the haptic domain demonstrated that schizophrenia patients were impaired in the haptic domain as well in the spatial domain. However, the schizophrenia patients showed almost no impairment on sensory-guided tasks. The results indicate that schizophrenia patients have deficits in representational processing. The deficit is also proved to be a heritable condition. in terms of performance in spatial working memory tasks, the MZ co-twins discordant for schizophrenia did not differ significantly from each other. </p>

        <h2>Executive Function Impairment</h2>

         <p> The following funcitons that require executive control are all impaired: </p> 

          <ol>

            <li>Focusing attention</li>
            <li> Inhibition </li>
            <li> Task management </li>
            <li> Set shifting </li>
            <li> Planning and implementing behavior </li>
            <li> Monitoring and updating </li>

        <h2>Social Cognition Impairment</h2>

        <p>Social cognition is the information processing about the social environment; refers to one's ability to perceive, interpret, and resopnd to social situations and interactions. There are three primary components of social cognition are:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt> <b> Affect recognition </b></dt>
            <dd>Emotion identification, lebeling, recognition, differentiation. Example of measuring task: emotion discrimination task and emotion matching task.</dd>
            <dt> <b> Theory of mind </b> </dt>
            <dd> Ability to infer thoughts, feelings, intentions of others. Example of tasks: Corcoran hinting task.</dd>
            <dt> <b> Attribution style </b> </dt>
            <dd>Ability to explain the causes of good and bad events in terms of the role of individuals vs. situational factors. Example of tasks: questionnaires describing scenario and asking whether the cause is due to other people, oneself, or situational factors.</dd>
          </dl>

        <p>Social cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are core features of the illness. They are not just a result of medication side effects or disease chronicity. These impairments are independent from neurocognitive mpairments, and can predict individual differences in functioning over and above neurocognitive impairments. Social cognitive impairments seem to be closer in the chain of causal factors that lead to poor functioining outcomes, i.e., instrumental activities, interpersonal functioning, vocational achievement than neurocognition. Overall, social cognitive impariments are a promising target for intervention. </p>
