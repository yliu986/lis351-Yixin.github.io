		<h2> Definition </h2>
			<p>The negative symptoms in schizophrenia is defined as a reduction of normal functions either related to motivation and interests, i.e., avolition, anhedonia, and asociality, or to expressive functions, i.e., blunted affect and alogia. Without much light, negative symptoms in fact serve to be a common etiological factor along the sepctrum of the disorder. "Negative symptoms may suggest a graver prognosis and poor response to treatment with neuroleptics, wheras positive symptoms are well defined in standard research instruments" (Andreasen, 1982). Thus, many have proposed that the coining and diagnosis of existing negative symptoms are crucial in treating and discovering the illness from its onset. Although negative symptoms might be confused with other transdiagnostic symptoms that feature other mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, the negative symptoms in schizophrenia have shown their validity of featuring the illness with its erelativ specifity and stablity in schizophrenia.</p>
