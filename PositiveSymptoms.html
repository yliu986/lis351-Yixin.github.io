		<h2 style="color:#FF7F50"> Definition </h2>
			<p style="line-height:1.5;">The definition of positive symptoms of schizophrenia from American Psychological Association (APA) suggest that they are a list of phenomelogical exhibitions that show an overflow or distortion of normal function. It can be understood as the "addition" of certain behaviors or thoughts. For instance, hallucination can be read as an addition of extra sensory input that does not exist objectively in reality. The delusion, on the other hand, can be seen as an addition of perplexed false beliefs that show significant deviance to that of a person without schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms are often the eye-capturing phenomena that entail most of the stereotypes regarding this illness. Namely, the public opinion about schizophrenia disorder is marjoly based on what is the most observable on a person's demonstratable characteristics, such as eccentric thoughts or idiosyncratic actions that seem unreasonable. </p>

		<h2 style="color:#FF7F50"> A List of Positive Symptoms </h2>
			<dl>
				<dt> <b> Hallucination </b> </dt>
				<dd style="line-height:1.5;"> Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception but occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. There are several types of hallucinations: auditory, visual, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory. An example of an auditory hallucination would be the experience of hearing things such as noises or the voices of people whispering or talking, that other people can't hear. These experiences must occur when the person is fully awakel the sounds may be heard either inside or outside of the person's head. Examples of auditory hallucinations are voices commenting and voices conversing with each other. In voices commenting, the person reports a voice that makes a running commentary on his behavior or thoughts. In voices conversing, the person experiences hearing two or more voices speaking to each other.</dd>
				<dt> <b> Delusion </b> </dt>
				<dd style="line-height:1.5;"> A delusion is a false personal belief based on incorrect inference about external reality and firmly sustained in spite of what almost everyone else believes and in spite of what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.  The belief is not one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person’s culture or subculture.”  Therefore, a delusion is a FALSE belief. Different types of delusion involve persecutory delusion, delusion of reference, grandiose delusion, delusion of being controlled, delusion of guilt or sin, and lastly, somatic delusion. </dd>
				<dt> <b> Perceptual distortion </b> </dt>
				<dd style="line-height:1.5;"> Perception distortion is a common phenomenon in negotiations. A perceiver's own needs, desires, motivation, and personal experiences may create a disposition about the other party. An example of perceptual distortion is to perceive someone in real life to have grown out devil's face, which might be mistakenly taken as a visual hallucination. However, as noted before, a visual hallucination requires the patient to have not received any sensory stimuli in real life yet still have activation on the sensory organ, i.e., eyes. Thus, this scenario in which the patient does perceive an objective target delineates perceptual distortion instead of hallucination.</dd>
				<dt> <b>Derealization</b></dt>
				<dd style="line-height:1.5;"> Derealization characterizes a sense of unreality. In such a state, nothing seems real including objects and people. It is a psychotic symptom when a person losese touch with reality, and is associated with a sense of detachment. An exmple of this would be me sitting here typing down these words whereas all of a sudden I feel like being detached from the perceived real world and can no longer hold truth of reality as real. No reference can be made to prove the validity of my existence. This would be described as a derealization process.</dd>
