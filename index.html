		<h1> Delineating Schizophrenia Disorder </h1>
		<h2 style="color:blue"> Abstract </h2>
		<p> The definition of schizophrenia is fairly simple. According to <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/schizophrenia#:~:text=Schizophrenia%20is%20a%20serious%20mental,violence%3A%20Debunking%20myths%2C%20addressing%20realities"> American Psychological Association </a>, schizophrenia is identified as a serious mental illness characterized by incoherent or illogical thoughts, bizarre behavior and speech, and delusions or hallucinations, such as hearing voices. However, such definition is insufficient in capturing the comprehensive picture of schizophrenia disorder by over-prioritizing the positive symptoms that take up most attentions in phenomelogical observation. Negative symptoms including alogia, anhedonia, flattened affect, impaired attention, and avolition, are also key diagnostic symptoms displayed by patients with schizophrenia. In addition to the negative symptoms, social cognitive deficits and neurocognitive deficits are also of great importance in the discussion of schizophrenia symptoms. Thus, this website aims to clarify these often overlooked aspects of schizophrenia and how they manifest to characterize the psychological illness of schizophrenia with an inclusive view. </p>
